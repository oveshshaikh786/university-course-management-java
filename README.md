# University Course Management System (Java)

This project is a Java-based application developed to practice advanced object-oriented programming concepts.  
It models a university system that offers both classroom and online courses and tracks learners, subjects, and grades.

## 🚀 Concepts Used
- Abstract Classes
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

## 🏫 Project Scenario
A university offers courses in two formats:
- Classroom-based courses
- Online courses

The system manages:
- Courses and subjects
- Learners
- Assignment and quiz scores
- Final grade calculations

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📚 Purpose
This project was created as part of an academic lab to strengthen understanding of advanced OOP concepts in Java.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add persistence (file or database storage)
- Improve grading logic
- Add UI (console or web-based)
